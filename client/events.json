Since then, I've been spending most of my time working on multi-layered data visualizations, and would love to talk through the creation of a few examples. I could also discuss the workflow I've developed to present them both as interactive visualizations on the web and as pre-rendered videos for consumption on twitter, facebook, etc.\n\n...on the other hand, I may have some new ideas by next year, so let's circle back a bit beforehand to make sure this is still the best topic.",
