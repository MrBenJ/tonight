The goal is to provide\nusers with a convenient tool for dynamic programming using familiar\nbrowser-like APIs. Trading backward compatibility for modernity, Deno\nis built around the new \"ES module\" standard. Third party imports are\ndone via URLs, which Deno can fetch out-of-the-box, thus providing a\nstandards-based distributed module system. Like in the browser, by\ndefault code is securely sandboxed - so users can run unaudited\nscripts with some confidence.",
