        "description": "A lot has happened in the five years since Val Karpov coined the MEAN stack to describe \"Full Stack\" Javascript stacks.\nReact rose to dominance, AWS Lambda started the Serverless movement, and Static Site Generators came back in a big way. \n\n\nWhat is driving this new stack of Javascript, APIs, and Markup? This is the story of how a JAM Stack cynic finally turned into a believer.",

        "description": "I recently left Google after ~4.5 years to work on some new projects. Since then, I've been spending most of my time working on multi-layered data visualizations, and would love to talk through the creation of a few examples. I could also discuss the workflow I've developed to present them both as interactive visualizations on the web and as pre-rendered videos for consumption on twitter, facebook, etc.\n\n...on the other hand, I may have some new ideas by next year, so let's circle back a bit beforehand to make sure this is still the best topic.",
