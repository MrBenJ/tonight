In this talk, I'll take you on a guided tour down the path I took from learning JavaScript to incorporating functional techniques into my daily practice. Along the way, you'll learn what Functional Programming is, why it's useful, and how you can start using it today!",

I know someone whose first name is one letter.

It’s okay to feel like you don’t know what you’re doing at your job, that’s your job as a Software Engineer.\n\nIn all 11 years of my career, every job I’ve had to learn there tech stack on the job, whether it was backbone, angularjs, or react. Instead what helped me in my career was focusing on the basics of programming and algorithms, and understanding the JavaScript Language itself.\n\nI want to share my story of how for every job I’ve had there we’re several moments where I had no idea what I was doing, but by focusing what I did know, and learning the foundations of what I needed to know. I’ve been able to build a pretty successful career.\n\nTLDR;\nFeeling like you don’t know what your doing is okay. Learn JavaScript not React, and you’ll be fine.",
